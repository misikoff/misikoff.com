Prettier is an opinionated code formatter, designed to stop tiresome debates
over styles. It offers a few options, but it's value is in enforcing reasonable
standards, rather than allowing for infinite customization. In the config file
below I've configured a few simple rules according to my own preferences.

# Setup

```bash
pnpm add -D prettier
```

```json title=".prettierrc"
{
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "jsxSingleQuote": true,
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

# (Optional) Tailwind CSS Class Sorting

```bash
pnpm add -D prettier-plugin-tailwind
```
