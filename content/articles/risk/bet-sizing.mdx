  A simple game demonstrates the effects of compounding earnings. Does expected
  value provide enough information to make a smart decision?

  , we looked at the effects of multiplicative payoffs on the expected value of a
  bet. We saw that the expected value of a bet is not enough information to make
  a smart decision. THe median outcome is a better measure of central tendency for
  asymmetric distributions.
</p>

In this article we will look at how we can adjust our betting strategy to raise
the median outcome.

## An alternative Strategy

We will keep the underlying odds and payoffs the same as the previous game. The
only difference will be that we can change our bet after each toss. You'll start
with $100 available to bet.

### In Summary:

You begin with **$100**. Before each of **10** consecutive coin tosses, you can
bet any amount of money you have available. You can bet all of it, none of it,
or any amount in between. You can bet a different amount each time.

- After each heads the pot
  <span className='font-extrabold text-green-700'>increases 50%</span>.
- After each tails the pot
  <span className='font-extrabold text-red-600'>decreases 40%</span>.

{/* Let's play a simpler game. We will flip a coin. If it lands on heads, we will <strong>triple</strong> our bet. If it lands on tails, we will lose everything. We will play this game 10 times. We will start with $100. */}

Rather than always betting everything we have, as in the last game. We will bet
a fixed percentage of our current wealth. This is called a <strong>fixed
fractional position sizing</strong>.
