Suppose you find a new game in your neighborhood casino. It costs **$100** to
play. Your bet is put into the pot. Your payoff is determined by **10**
consecutive coin tosses.

- After each heads the pot
  <span className='font-extrabold text-green-700'>increases 50%</span>.
- After each tails the pot
  <span className='font-extrabold text-red-600'>decreases 40%</span>.

After **10** tosses, whatever's in the pot is yours.

You perform some quick calculations and find the expected value of the pot at
the end of the game is about **$162.88**.

Would you play?
