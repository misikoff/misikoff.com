Suppose you find a new game in your neighborhood casino.
It costs **$100** to play. Your bet is put into the pot. Your
payoff is determined by **10** consecutive coin tosses.

* After each heads the pot is <span className="font-extrabold text-green-700">increased 50%</span>.
* After each tails the pot is <span className="font-extrabold text-red-600">decreased 40%</span>.

After **10** tosses, whatever's in the pot is yours.

## Phone-A-Friend

Curious, you call up your friend, a fellow studying mathematics at MIT. He's rather busy. You explain the situation and he jots it all down. After a few minutes he says the expected value of the pot at the end of the game is about **$162.88**. He wishes you luck as he hurries off the phone to make it to office hours.
