No prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been
beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists
is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth rattle beneath his
opponent's fist, who has been tripped and felt the full force of his adversary's
charge, who has been downed in bloody but not it spirit, one who as often as he
falls, rises again with greater defiance than ever.
