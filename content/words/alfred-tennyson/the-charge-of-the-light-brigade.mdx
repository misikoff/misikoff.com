#### I

Half a league, half a league,<br/ > Half a league onward,<br/ > All in the
valley of Death<br/ > {indentation}Rode the six hundred.<br/ > “Forward, the
Light Brigade!<br/ > Charge for the guns!” he said.<br/ > Into the valley of
Death<br/ > {indentation}Rode the six hundred.<br/ >

#### II

“Forward, the Light Brigade!”<br/ > Was there a man dismayed?<br/ > Not though
the soldier knew<br/ > {indentation}Someone had blundered.<br/ >
{indentation}Theirs not to make reply,<br/ > {indentation}Theirs not to reason
why,<br/ > {indentation}Theirs but to do and die.<br/ > {indentation}Into the
valley of Death<br/ > {indentation}Rode the six hundred.<br/ >

#### III

Cannon to right of them,<br/ > Cannon to left of them,<br/ > Cannon in front of
them<br/ > {indentation}Volleyed and thundered;<br/ > Stormed at with shot and
shell,<br/ > Boldly they rode and well,<br/ > Into the jaws of Death,<br/ > Into
the mouth of hell<br/ > {indentation}Rode the six hundred.<br/ >

#### IV

Flashed all their sabres bare,<br/ > Flashed as they turned in air<br/ > Sabring
the gunners there,<br/ > Charging an army, while<br/ > {indentation}All the
world wondered.<br/ > Plunged in the battery-smoke<br/ > Right through the line
they broke;<br/ > Cossack and Russian<br/ > Reeled from the sabre stroke<br/ >
{indentation}Shattered and sundered.<br/ > Then they rode back, but not<br/ >
{indentation}Not the six hundred.<br/ >

#### V

Cannon to right of them,<br/ > Cannon to left of them,<br/ > Cannon behind
them<br/ > {indentation}Volleyed and thundered;<br/ > Stormed at with shot and
shell,<br/ > While horse and hero fell.<br/ > They that had fought so well<br/ >
Came through the jaws of Death,<br/ > Back from the mouth of hell,<br/ > All
that was left of them,<br/ > {indentation}Left of six hundred.<br/ >

#### VI

When can their glory fade?<br/ > O the wild charge they made!<br/ >
{indentation}All the world wondered.<br/ > Honour the charge they made!<br/ >
Honour the Light Brigade,<br/ > Noble six hundred!
