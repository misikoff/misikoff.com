export const indentation = <span className='mr-7' />

<div className='w-fit mx-auto'>
  Out of the night that covers me, <br />
  {indentation}Black as the pit from pole to pole, <br />
  I thank whatever gods may be <br />
  {indentation}For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance <br /> {indentation}I have not winced nor
cried aloud. <br /> Under the bludgeonings of chance <br /> {indentation}My head
is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br /> {indentation}Looms but the Horror of
the shade, <br /> And yet themenace of the year <br /> {indentation}Finds and
shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,<br /> {indentation}How charged with
punishments the scroll, <br /> I am the master of my fate,<br /> {indentation}I
am the captain of my soul.
