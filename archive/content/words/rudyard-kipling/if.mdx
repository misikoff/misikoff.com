If you can keep your head when all about you <br /> {indentation}Are losing
theirs and blaming it on you, <br /> If you can trust yourself when all men
doubt you, <br /> {indentation}But make allowance for their doubting too; <br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br /> {indentation}Or being lied
about, don't deal in lies, <br /> Or being hated, don't give way to
hating,<br /> {indentation}And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; <br /> {indentation}If you can
think—and not make thoughts your aim; <br /> If you can meet with Triumph and
Disaster <br /> {indentation}And treat those two impostors just the same; <br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken <br /> {indentation}Twisted by
knaves to make a trap for fools, <br /> Or watch the things you gave your life
to, broken, <br /> {indentation}And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br /> {indentation}And risk it on
one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br /> And lose, and start again at your
beginnings<br /> {indentation}And never breathe a word about your loss; <br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br /> {indentation}To serve
your turn long after they are gone, <br /> And so hold on when there is nothing
in you <br /> { indentation } Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br /> {indentation}Or walk
with Kings—nor lose the common touch, <br /> If neither foes nor loving friends
can hurt you, <br /> {indentation}If all men count with you, but none too
much;<br /> If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br /> {indentation}With
sixty seconds' worth of distance run, <br /> Yours is the Earth and everything
that's in it, <br /> {indentation}And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son!
