          <h2>
            Why doesn{"'"}t the order of the results matter when calculating the
            outcome?
          </h2>
          Let{"'"}s think of this in terms of multiplication, rather than adding
          or subtracting a proportion of the pot after each toss.
          <br />
          <br />
          After each toss we multiply the pot by some number. In the scenario
          above, we multiply the pot by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150% {'—>'} 1.5) after
          each heads, <br />
          and by 0.6 (100% - 40% = 60% {'—>'} 0.6) after each tails.
          <br />
          <br />
          So we can call <b>1.5</b> the heads factor and <b>0.6</b> the tails
          factor.
          <br />
          <br />
          <pre>
            Let <b>H</b> denote a coin toss landing on heads.
            <br />
            Let <b>T</b> denote a coin toss landing on tails.
            <br />
            Let <i>b</i> denote your bet.
          </pre>
          <h3>
            Imagine we get <b>7</b> heads and <b>3</b> tails. <br />
            Consider two orderings: <b>HHHHHHHTTT</b> and <b>HHTHHTHHTH</b>.
          </h3>
          <pre>
            The result of <b> HHHHHHHTTT</b> can be expressed as: <br />
            1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * <i>
              b
            </i>{' '}
            = (1.5<sup>7</sup>)(0.6<sup>3</sup>)<i>b</i>
          </pre>
          <pre>
            The result of <b> HHTHHTHHTH</b> can be expressed as: <br />
            1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 1.5 * <i>b</i>
          </pre>
          Since multiplication is commutative, the order of multiplication does
          not matter.
          <br />
          This means we can rearrange the factors however we would like. For
          instance, we can put all the 1.5 factors next to each other:
          <pre>
            1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 1.5 * <i>b</i>
            <br />= 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 *{' '}
            <i>b</i>
            <br />= (1.5<sup>7</sup>)(0.6<sup>3</sup>)<i>b</i>
            <br />
            {'->'} just like when the ordering was <b>HHHHHHHTTT</b>
          </pre>
          Now we can see that <b>HHHHHHHTTT</b> yields the same outcome as{' '}
          <b>HHTHHTHHTH</b>. This holds for any two orders that share a heads
          count and a tails count. Their outcomes will be the same.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since we can always rearrange the factors to put the heads factors
          together and the tails factors together, we can always express the
          result as follows:

            5 tails?
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Let{"'"}s think of this in terms of multiplication, rather than
            adding or subtracting a proportion of the pot.
          </h3>
          <pre>
            Adding 50% of the pot leaves you with 150% of the pot. (100% + 50%)
            <br />
            150% of x = 1.5x
            <br />
            This means the heads factor is 1.5.
            <br />
            <br />
            Reducing the pot by 40% leaves you with 60% of the pot. (100% - 40%)
            <br />
            60% of x = 0.6x
            <br />
            This means the tails factor is 0.6.
            <br />
          </pre>
          <h3>Imagine you only get two tosses.</h3>
          <p>
            If you get 1 heads and 1 tails, we can represent the result as
            follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
            heads factor * tails factor * <i>b</i>, where <i>b</i> is your bet
            <br />= 1.5 * 0.6 * <i>b</i>
            <br />= 0.9 * <i>b</i>
            <br />= 90% of <i>b</i>
            <br />
            {'->'} you lost 10% of your bet.
          </pre>
          To break even, you need the tails factor to be the reciprocal of the
          heads factor, because a number multiplied by its reciprocal is 1,
          i.e., 100%. If, like in the scenario above, the heads factor is 1.5
          (which can be represented as{' '}
          <FractionHelper numerator={3} denominator={2} />) you would need the
          tails factor to be its reciprocal,{' '}
          <FractionHelper numerator={2} denominator={3} />. A tails factor of{' '}
          <FractionHelper numerator={2} denominator={3} /> corresponds to losing
          33.333% after each tails.
          <pre>
            heads factor * tails factor * b<br /> ={' '}
            <FractionHelper numerator={3} denominator={2} /> *{' '}
            <FractionHelper numerator={2} denominator={3} /> * <i>b</i>
            <br />= <FractionHelper numerator={6} denominator={6} /> * <i>b</i>
            <br />= 1 * <i>b</i> = <i>b</i>
          </pre>
          The loss of 40% described above is a larger loss, so you would lose
          money.
          <br />
          This principle is true regardless of how many coin tosses there are.
          <br />
          <h4> Given an equal number of heads and tails:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You break even if the factors are reciprocals of each other.
            </li>

            <li>
              You make a profit if a factor is larger than the reciprocal of the
              other factor.
            </li>

            <li>
              You lose money if a factor is smaller than the reciprocal of the
              other factor.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Another example</h3>
          <h4>
            If tails means you lose 25%, how much would you have to gain on
            heads to break even when you get the same number of heads as tails?
          </h4>
          <pre>
            Losing 25% means you are left with 75% of what you had. (100% - 25%
            = 75%).
            <br />
            75% = <FractionHelper numerator={75} denominator={100} /> ={' '}
            <FractionHelper numerator={3} denominator={4} />.
            <br />
            {'->'} the tails factor is{' '}
            <FractionHelper numerator={3} denominator={4} />.
            <br />
            <br />
            The reciprocal of <FractionHelper
              numerator={3}
              denominator={4}
            />{' '}
            is <FractionHelper numerator={4} denominator={3} />.
            <br />
            {'->'} the heads factor is{' '}
            <FractionHelper numerator={4} denominator={3} />.
            <br />
            <br />
            <FractionHelper numerator={4} denominator={3} /> = 1.33333.
            <br />
            As a percent, that{"'"}s 133.333%.
            <br />
            That{"'"}s equivalent to a gain of 33.333%. (133.333% = 100% +
            33.333%)
          </pre>
          <br />
          Therefore, you would need to gain 33.333% on heads in order to break
          even.
